# MyFirst_WebApp
This is my first MVC application that shows the technique combined HTML, CSS, Javascript, and C# via ASP.NET MVC framework.

# Video Demonstration
There is a Demonstration.mp4 for demonstration

# Folder strcuture
Content: CSS files
Controllers: control the action and data flow between View and Backend
fronts: the picture or contents that the user interface needs
Models: the data classes (i haven;t use it, since my side project haven;t touched backend storeage)
Scripts: Javascript files
Views: HTML files

# My code
Since the sturcutre of this project is based on Microsoft MVC example, most of the items are derived from there.
My code are primary in Contollers (HomeController.cs) and Views (Index.cshtml, About.cshtml, Contact.cshtml). 

# HTML CSS Javascript 
HTML work as a main page structure that shapes all the action page.
Basic CSS element is loaded from Layout.cshtml, and some specific CSS element are defined in style block in Index.cshtml.
Javascript have shown its capabity to change HTML attribute values (such as the source of the image and the text in the button).
